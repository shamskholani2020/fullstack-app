## 🎨 Design Philosophy - Beginner-Friendly

### Core Principles
1. **NO HIDDEN ACTIONS** - Everything explicit
2. **NO DEFAULTS** - User chooses everything
3. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - State everything clearly
4. **NO TECH JARGON** - Plain language
5. **NO COMPLEXITY** - One screen = One task

### Visual Design

**Minimalist:**
- Clean white background
- High contrast text
- Large, clear typography
- Plenty of whitespace

**Simple Navigation:**
- **Hamburger menu** - Always visible, not hidden
- **Tab bar at bottom** - Easy thumb access (mobile)
- **Back button** - Always visible, no gestures
- **Home button** - One tap to start

**Obvious Buttons:**
- Primary action: BIG, GREEN
- Secondary action: Medium, GRAY
- Cancel action: RED
- **ALL BUTTONS HAVE TEXT LABELS** - No icons only

**Data Display:**
- Numbers: BIG FONT
- Currency: Symbol BEFORE number ($100 not 100$)
- Negative values: RED color
- Positive values: GREEN color
- Empty states: "Tap here to add [item]"

### Onboarding - First-Time User

**Welcome Screen (Mandatory):**
- [ ] **"What do you do?"** - Carpenter, Admin, Sales
- [ ] Skip option: "I'm just browsing"
- [ ] Language selection: Arabic / English

**First Time Carpenter:**
- [ ] Quick tutorial: 3 screens, swipe to learn
- [ ] Screen 1: "This is your catalog - tap products"
- [ ] Screen 2: "This saves your calculations - tap tools"
- [ ] Screen 3: "Tap here to start browsing"
- [ ] Can skip anytime, can see again in settings

**Error Prevention:**
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs before deleting
- [ ] "Are you sure?" on important actions
- [ ] Undo option for 5 seconds
- [ ] Can't navigate without saving (shows warning)

## 💱 Currency System

### Exchange Rate Logic

**New Syrian Pound Rule:**
```javascript
// Conversion: Old SYP to New SYP
// 10,000 Old SYP = 100 New SYP

const NEW_SYP_PER_OLD_SYP = 100 / 10000; // 0.01

// Example:
const priceInOldSYP = 50000; // 50,000 Old SYP
const priceInNewSYP = priceInOldSYP * NEW_SYP_PER_OLD_SYP; // 500 New SYP

// Display to user:
"Price: 50,000 Old SYP = 500 New SYP"
```

**Dual Display Mode:**
```
[Product: MDF Plain 16mm]
Price: $12.50 USD
       = 1,250,000 Old SYP
       = 12,500 New SYP (PRIMARY DISPLAY)
```

**API + Manual Fallback:**
```javascript
// Default: Try API first
let exchangeRate = await fetchExchangeRate(); // API

// Fallback: If API fails, use last known rate
if (!exchangeRate) {
  exchangeRate = localStorage.getItem('lastKnownRate');
}

// Admin can override manually
if (adminOverride) {
  exchangeRate = adminOverride;
  saveToDatabase(exchangeRate);
}
```

### Display Format

**Everywhere money appears:**
```
[PRIMARY]    $12.50 USD
[SECONDARY] 12,500 New SYP
[REFERENCE]  1,250,000 Old SYP (small, gray)
```

---

## 🗂 Updated Data Structure

### Exchange Rate Schema (Updated)
```typescript
interface ExchangeRate {
  id: string;
  usdToOldSYP: number;    // e.g., 13,500
  usdToNewSYP: number;    // e.g., 135
  conversionRatio: number;   // 0.01 (10,000 old = 100 new)
  timestamp: Date;
  source: 'api' | 'manual' | 'government-announcement';
  isOfficialRate: boolean; // From government announcement
}
```

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### After Launch (Week 8)
- [ ] App loads in < 3 seconds (offline)
- [ ] First-time user completes first calculation in < 1 minute
- [ ] All 23 utilities accessible within 3 taps
- [ ] No user can make a "wrong" action (too many protections)
- [ ] Works completely offline for 48 hours

### After 1 Month
- [ ] 50+ carpenters actively using
- [ ] 10+ admins managing inventory
- [ ] 100+ quotes generated
- [ ] < 5% crash rate
- [ ] < 10s sync time when online

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Network issues:** → Complete offline mode already designed
- **Exchange rate volatility:** → Real-time API + manual override
- **Large image storage:** → Compress images, cache frequently used
- **Device compatibility:** → Test on old Android phones (5+ years old)

### User Risks
- **First-time confusion:** → Mandatory onboarding, explicit UI
- **Wrong calculations:** → Validation on every input, show expected ranges
- **Data loss:** → Auto-save every 30 seconds
- **Admin errors:** → Undo button, backup daily

---

## 📝 Final Questions Before Development

### Development Decisions
1. **Supabase vs. Local Only:**
   - Option A: Supabase cloud + local sync (recommended)
   - Option B: Local SQLite only (simpler, no sync)
   - *Your choice?*

2. **Map Integration:**
   - Full Google Maps (needs API key, costs money)
   - OpenStreetMap (free, less detailed)
   - No maps (just distance in km)
   - *Your choice?*

3. **Push Notifications:**
   - Use (web push, needs service worker)
   - No (just check manually)
   - *Your choice?*

4. **WhatsApp Integration:**
   - Auto-send via WhatsApp Business API (costs money, reliable)
   - Just open WhatsApp with message (free, manual)
   - *Your choice?*

5. **Admin Auth:**
   - Phone number (SMS verification)
   - Email + Password
   - No auth (anyone can access admin panel)
   - *Your choice?*
